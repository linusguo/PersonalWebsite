# Personal website-Yusheng Guo

**Website deployed on Heroku:**
<https://personal-website-yusheng.herokuapp.com/index.html>

Welcome to my website! This site is as part of the Project 1 in CS5610, summer 2021.

* This website has a landing page defined in `index.html`, including a welcome message and a minimal information about what this website is. Using the navbar fixed on the bottom of this page, visitors can navigate themselves to other internal and external links.

* From the landing page, visitors can view two internal pages, `About me` and `Publication`, using the link on the navbar.

The `About me` page includes a short introduction of myself and a profile image of mine, followed by my education backgrounds. I took the advantage of `HTML table` to arrange the content on this page.
